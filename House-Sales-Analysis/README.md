## 📄Overview
In this assignment, I worked as a Data Analyst for a Real Estate Investment Trust. My task was to determine the market price of houses based on a given set of features. I analyzed and predicted housing prices using attributes such as square footage, number of bedrooms, number of floors, and more.
