# 🏡Chicago's Data Analysis Project



## 📄Overview
In this project, I worked with real-world datasets (like socio-economic indicators, school performance, and crime dataset of Chicago). I loaded these datasets into a database, extracted insights using Python, and SQL queries.
## 📊Datasets

- **File Size:** 
  - ***(i)*** 79 rows and 9 columns 
  - ***(ii)*** 567 rows and 78 columns 
   - ***(iii)*** 534 rows and 23 columns
  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Tools / Skills used:** SQL (queries, SQLite3, SQL magic), Python libraries (Pandas, PrettyTable), and Jupyter notebook.
## 🚀Steps / Workflow
1.  Loaded Chicago's datasets into SQLite using Pandas and SQLite3 for easy querying and analysis.
2. Utilized SQL magic in Jupyter Notebooks to interact with the database and visualize query results using PrettyTable.
3. Analyzed dataset by executing SQL queries to find insights and support decisions.
## 🎯Results
- Most crimes occurred in Austin Community.
- Riverdale community has the highest percentage of households below the poverty line.
- West Garfield Park community has the lowest per capita income.
